### Django
Python web framework
A Django site starts off as a project and is built up with a number of applications that each handle separate functionality
in this case we have two (the portfolio and the blog)
Each app follows the Model-View-Template pattern

#### About MVT pattern

In Django, the architecture is slightly different. Although based upon the MVC pattern, Django handles the controller part itself. 
The view and template in the MVT pattern make up the view in the MVC pattern
